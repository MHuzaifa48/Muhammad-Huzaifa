# Ticket Generating Machine project In C Language

The Ticket Generating Machine project in C language is designed to create and display random ticket numbers. It utilizes the `stdlib.h` and `time.h` libraries to generate a random ticket number within a specified range. The `generateTicketNumber()` function generates a random number between 1 and 10000, which serves as the ticket number. The main function calls this function to generate a ticket number and then displays it to the user. This project can be extended by adding features such as generating multiple tickets, storing ticket information, or implementing different ticket types.
